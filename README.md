That's my new arduino shield. I called it #Hackduino.

Whenever I want to try a new project I have to take a lot of components which are usually same basic like breadboard, switch, pot and some leds.

Now I make a shield for myself with pre assembled some basic components.
It has
> 4 Leds
> 4 Tactile Switch
> Sonar sensor
> HC05
> TSOP1738
> Buzzer
And breadboard obviouslyðŸ˜Š.

Arduino is attached at bottom.
